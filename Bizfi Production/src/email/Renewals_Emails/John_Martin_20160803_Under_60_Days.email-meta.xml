    <textOnly>Good Morning,

I hope all is well and that the program is running smoothly!  I understand you are busy and have noticed email is typically the best channel when it comes to keeping the lines of communication open.  If you would like to review either: the current balance OR additional funding opportunities, please reply to this email with one of the below and I&apos;ll be sure to update you accordingly:

#1 for balance update
#2 for additional funding requests
#3 for BOTH *


With Gratitude,

John Martin
