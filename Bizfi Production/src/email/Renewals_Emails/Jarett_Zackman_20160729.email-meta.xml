    <textOnly>Good afternoon,

I hope all is well and the program we&apos;ve placed your business in is running smoothly!

If you would like to review either the current balance OR additional funding opportunities, please reply to this email with one of the below and I will be sure to update everyone accordingly.  If you choose 2 or 3, please reply with your last 3 months of bank statements.  I look forward to hearing from you.  Have a great day!

#1 for balance update
#2 for additional funding requests
