    <textOnly>Greetings,

I wanted to touch base and let you know that we still have your pre-approved funding account active and ready to transfer.  I previously sent you an application to complete and submit with the necessary documentation.

I am your assigned account representative and will walk you through the application process to ensure that you get the funding your business needs.

Please feel free to contact me at {!Account.OwnerPhone} or just reply to this email with any questions you may have.

Thanks!

Sincerely,

{!Account.OwnerFullName}
Senior Account Executive</textOnly>
