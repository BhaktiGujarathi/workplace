    <textOnly>Hello {!Lead.FirstName}

Thank you for inquiring about business financing with Bizfi.  I have attempted to contact you in order to start the funding process but have been unsuccessful.  If you are still in need of working capital for your business I can help you get the financing to grow your business.

**If the information that you have already provided is not the best method in which to contact you immediately, please reply to this email with the best contact information (e.g. - cell phone, home phone, alternative email, etc.) so I can reach out to you today.**

In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me at {!Lead.OwnerPhone} or just reply to this email with any questions.

Thank you again for giving us the opportunity to work with you!

Sincerely,

{!Lead.OwnerFirstName} {!Lead.OwnerLastName}
