    <textOnly>Dear {!Opportunity.Account},  

We have not received your forms to set up automatic payments for your FUNDINGO Student Loan.   If you would like to have your loan paid automatically from your FUNDINGO checking account and receive a 0.25% rate reduction, please complete the forms we emailed to you and return them as soon as possible.  If you did not receive the forms, please let us know and we can email them out to you.  

Thank you!
