Hello {!Contact.FirstName}, 

As a reminder, insurance is still due for your event on {!Case.Event_Start__c}.  Please make sure to upload insurance that meets City & County of San Francisco requirements by {!Case.Insurance_Needed_by_Date__c}.  Log into the SFMTA system by navigating directly to your case online using the link provided below and add the attachment. Please note that the street closure permit is invalid if sufficient insurance is not received.  

If you have not already done so, please also upload a letter or copy of the invoice for the garbage/recycling vendors and event clean-up at this time. As a reminder, the recycling vendor must have a certificate from the Department of the Environment confirming completion of their training program. Event producers are also required to attend a zero waste event training.
