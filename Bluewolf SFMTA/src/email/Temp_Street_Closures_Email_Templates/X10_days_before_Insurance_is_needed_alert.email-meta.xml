    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

As a reminder, insurance is still due for your event on {!Case.Event_Start__c}. Please make sure to upload insurance that meets City &amp; County of San Francisco requirements - directions here for posting by {!Case.Insurance_Needed_by_Date__c}. Please note that the street closure permit is invalid if sufficient insurance is not received.

If you have not already done so, please also upload a letter or copy of the invoice for the garbage/recycling vendors and event clean-up at this time. As a reminder, the recycling vendor must have a certificate from the Department of the Environment confirming completion of their training program. Event producers are also required to attend a zero waste event training.

To view your online request, follow the link provided below:

Thank you,
