Greetings. This email confirms your tow hearing is scheduled for {!Case.Date_Hearing_Scheduled__c}.

The SFMTA Customer Service Center is located at 11 South Van Ness Ave. between Mission and Market Streets (across from SF Honda).  

When you arrive, do not wait in line.  Check in with the guard, take a seat and wait for the hearing officer to call your name.  

Do not park on Mission Street in the afternoon as the location becomes a tow away zone.  As always please check for parking restrictions within 100 feet of your vehicle.

Regards,
