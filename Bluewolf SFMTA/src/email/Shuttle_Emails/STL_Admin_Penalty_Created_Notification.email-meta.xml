    <textOnly>Hi {!Case.Account},

A new admin penalty was created for one of your vehicles on {!Case.STL_Issue_Date__c} between {!Case.STL_Violation_Timestamp_Start__c} and {!Case.STL_Violation_Timestamp_End__c}. Please log into your community portal to review this penalty: {!Case.Link}. 

Any appeal of this violation, needs to be contested inside the community portal within 5 business days. Please attach supporting documentation as part of your appeal (e.g. screenshots of your internal GPS tracking system, dispatch reports, correspondence containing route information, etc.). We will review the appeal and supporting documentation and notify you if the appealed violations will be removed.

If you wish to appeal a violation after 5 business days or do not agree with our findings upon reviewing your appeal, you can request a formal hearing with an SFMTA hearing officer. As a reminder, our admin penalty fee is $250 per vehicle run on restricted streets per day.

Thanks,
SFMTA</textOnly>
