    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

Thank you for your bicycle corral request. On-street bicycle corrals are bicycle racks placed in the parking lane on the roadway where short term ( less than two hours) demand for bike parking is higher than can be accommodated on the sidewalk. Please fill out the application provided in the link below and email the completed application to bikeparking@sfmta.com for staff review.  [NEED BIKE CORRAL APPLICATION LINK]

Thank you,
